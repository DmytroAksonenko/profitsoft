#### Homework

#### `Here my homework for lectures 1 and 2:`
1. Make a method that takes an array of integers and returns only those that are positive (> = 0), sort them in descending order. Write unit tests

2. Write a method that accepts a list of text strings that may contain hash tags ("#"). As a result, the method should return the top 5 most frequently mentioned hash tags, indicating the number of times each has been mentioned. Several of the same hash tags on the same line should be counted as one mention. Write unit tests

3. Implement a method that sorts geometric 3d figures by volume. The method accepts a collection of arbitrary geometric shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder). Write unit tests

#### `Homework for lectures 3 and 4:`
Here it is necessary to read the JSON files with data on fines for traffic violations in parallel threads. As a result, you need to create 2 text files. The first contains the types of traffic fines summed for all years and sorted in descending order. The second displays a list of violators indicating the total amount of the fine, the average amount and the number of violations.
